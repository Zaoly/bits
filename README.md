# bits

**C++ header files in "bits" directory of GCC MinGW 32**

Plenty of contestants in Lanqiao Bei, Tianti Contest, ICPC, CCPC, NOI, NOIP, IOI, and other contests in Informatics, do not have a header file “bits/stdc++.h” or “extc++.h” in their compiler. So I uploaded these files for them to download.
